# playing-with-berlin-subways
This repository will hold code used to analyze all the properties in Berlin, calculating their proximity (or lack thereof) to subway entrances.

For a quick look at the basic code I am going to use to analyze minimum subway distance, see this file (which completes a similar task for Manhattan properties, spitting out distances from the closest NYC subway stops):

For a quick look at the source of my layer showing all Berlin properties, see this ESRI page:

For a quick look at how I got the second layer I needed (showing all subway entrances), see this Stack Exchange thread:
